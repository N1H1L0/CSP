# CSP_2020-21

A compilation of most of the make projects from code.org's AP Computer Science Principles course from the 2020-2021 version of the course. 

## Installation

All you need to do to view the working project is to look for the link at the top of the code and follow it. 

## Usage

Look at the code to learn and don't just copy and paste. Although programmers often copy and paste that doesn't help you understand what is happening or actually learn to code things your self. Use this as a tool to learn not as a way to easily pass the class. 

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :)

## TODOs

* Improve comments in the code for beginners
* Update code to be for the latest version of the class
* Make the code more elegant

## License

TODO: Write license
